# Coding-Journey
Hi! I'm a second-year Computer Science student at the University of New Brunswick (UNB), and this repository contains a collection of beginner-friendly Java console applications I built to enhance my programming skills and showcase my understanding of Java fundamentals. Each project demonstrates a different concept, from data handling to user interaction, and I hope these examples reflect my progress and learning in Java.
